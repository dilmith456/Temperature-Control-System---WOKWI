# Temperature-Control-System---WOKWI
This system is based on room temperature control. By the temperature sensor you can adjust the temperature and you can see it on the LCD display. When the temperature is OK 'GREEN LED' will power ON, when temperature is COOL 'BLUE LED' will power ON, when temperature is OVERHEAT 'RED LED' will power ON.
